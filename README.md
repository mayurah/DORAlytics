# DORAlytics - DORA metrics in container

> üì¶ [Middleware‚Äôs open DORA](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware/) stack - containerized for speed, simplicity, and instant engineering insights ‚ú®.



‚ú® To deploy DORA metrics (Docker / Portainer)

> **TODO**

- Create CI to follow middleware's instruction 
- Build and publish 
- Add docker run
- Add docker-compose example
- Add additional resouces

## ‚ö° Instantly deploy Middleware's OSS DORA metrics platform via Docker üê≥ ‚Äî no setup, just insights.

### Option 1: Docker / Podman 

> üöÄ One-line deploy of OSS DORA metrics for your engineering teams.

```sh

```

### Option 2: Docker Compose / Portainer

> Customizable YAML

```yaml

```


## Acknowledgement

Kudos to middleware team and their contributors!

This is simplified version of middleware's opensource stack offering ( DORA metrics )  with container image pre-built.

## Additional names that I thought while naming this container.

- Zero to DORA (Inspired by ‚ÄúZero to Prod‚Äù)
- DORA-in-a-Box
- DevOps Research and Assessment Container


## For those new to DORA and Engineering efficiency.

Dora focuses on these four (and few additional) elements

- Deployment Frequency: How often code is deployed to production. 
- Lead Time for Changes: The time it takes for a code commit to become production-ready. 
- Change Failure Rate: The percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production. 
- Mean Time to Restore: The time it takes to recover from a total failure or partial service interruption.
